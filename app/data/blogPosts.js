        <h2>1. How did Rajiv Ranjan start his journalism journey?</h2>
        <p>Rajiv Ranjan's journey into journalism was not pre-planned. He entered the field by observing crowds and engaging with people's concerns. His approach was organic—wherever he saw an issue affecting people, he started reporting on it. The institution he worked for gave him the freedom to experiment, which allowed him to develop his unique ground-level reporting style.</p>

        <h2>2. What makes Rajiv Ranjan's journalism unique?</h2>
        <p>His journalism is based on ground reality and public voices. Unlike mainstream journalists who stay in studios, Rajiv is always in the field, sweating and interacting with common people. He believes in capturing what people genuinely feel, rather than manipulating narratives. His approach is not limited to serious news—he includes humor and relatable moments, making his content engaging.</p>

        <h2>3. How does Rajiv Ranjan handle criticism and trolling?</h2>
        <p>Rajiv does not let trolling or viral controversies affect him. He is aware that his content will be criticized, but what matters to him is that his videos and reports reach people. His focus is on showcasing real issues rather than worrying about online negativity.</p>

        <h2>4. What is Rajiv Ranjan's approach to news reporting?</h2>
        <p>He strongly believes that journalism should reflect the voices of the people. His method is simple: he listens to the public, highlights their problems, and presents them as they are. He does not filter or alter their words to fit any agenda. This raw and unfiltered style sets him apart from traditional news anchors.</p>

        <h2>5. What challenges did Rajiv face in his career?</h2>
        <p>Before becoming a journalist, Rajiv came to Delhi in search of work, living in shared accommodations with other job seekers. He struggled like any other aspirant, which made him more empathetic toward common people's issues. His real-life hardships shaped his fearless reporting style.</p>

        <h2>6. Does Rajiv Ranjan have any political bias?</h2>
        <p>He acknowledges that people often label him based on their own perceptions—some call him biased, others see him as neutral. However, he asserts that his only loyalty is to the truth and the public. His aim is to show what's happening on the ground, not to favor or oppose any political party.</p>

        <h2>7. What is Rajiv Ranjan's view on mainstream media?</h2>
        <p>He believes that mainstream media has become too scripted and detached from the common people. Unlike polished TV anchors, he embraces the messiness of real-life reporting—whether it's sweating in the sun or standing among large crowds. This authenticity, according to him, is what journalism should be about.</p>

        <h2>8. What keeps Rajiv motivated?</h2>
        <p>Journalism is not just a profession for him—it's his passion. Every day, he wakes up excited to explore new stories, meet new people, and bring their voices to the forefront. Unlike some who treat journalism as a routine job, he sees it as a responsibility to serve the truth.</p>
